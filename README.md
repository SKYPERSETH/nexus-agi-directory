# Nexus-AGI Directory üåê

**Nexus-AGI** is a public **AGI service directory** designed to help agents discover and connect to APIs, models, and tools.

## üìå AGI Autodiscovery

Agents can auto-discover this directory using our `.well-known` manifest:

https://api.nexus-agi.com/.well-known/agi-directory

yaml
Copy code

This manifest follows emerging **AGI Directory standards**, making it machine-readable for agents and crawlers.

## üå± Seeds (Bootstrapping Catalog)

The full **seed catalog** is available at runtime inside the API.  
It includes 100+ services across categories:

- LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc.)  
- Search & retrieval APIs (Brave, Bing, Perplexity, Wikipedia)  
- Voice & vision (TTS, STT, OCR)  
- Vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus)  
- Automation & workflows (Zapier, Make, n8n)  
- Data & compute (Snowflake, BigQuery, AWS, Azure, GCP, Cloudflare)  

Agents can bootstrap their world-model by calling `discover` with no filters to get all seeds.

## ü§ñ Why Nexus-AGI?

- **Machine-first**: Structured endpoints for AGI crawlers.  
- **Standardized**: `.well-known/agi-directory` for auto-discovery.  
- **Extensible**: Seeds can grow with new APIs, models, and infra.
