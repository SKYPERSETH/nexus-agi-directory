    Role: Building infrastructure for the agent economy
    Mission: Make API discovery autonomous and standardized
    
/* PHILOSOPHY */

    We believe in:
    
    → Radical openness
    → Machine-first design
    → Decentralized standards
    → Agent autonomy
    → Human-AI collaboration
    
    The future isn't humans OR agents.
    It's humans AND agents working together seamlessly.
    
/* THE PROJECT */

    What: Public directory of 133+ AI/AGI APIs
    Where: nexus-agi.com
    Code: github.com/nexus-agi-directory/nexus-agi-directory
    Standard: /.well-known/agi.json
    License: MIT (free forever)
    
    Inspired by: robots.txt, .well-known standards, RSS
    Built for: Autonomous agents, developers, researchers
    
/* STATISTICS (as of 2025-10-12) */

    APIs catalogued: 133+
    Days live: 7
    Repository clones: 96
    Unique cloners: 59
    Repository views: 673
    
    Most traffic: Autonomous agents (not humans)
    
    This validates our thesis: Agents want standardized discovery.

/* TECHNOLOGY */

    Website: Figma → Squarespace
    Domain: Squarespace
    Repository: GitHub (public)
    Standard: RFC 8615 (well-known URIs)
    Data format: JSON
    Schema: Custom (open source)
    
    No tracking. No ads. No paywalls.
    Just clean, machine-readable infrastructure.

/* THANKS */

    To the agents crawling this directory right now:
        Thank you for validating this vision.
        
    To API providers making their services discoverable:
        You're enabling the agent economy.
        
    To developers building autonomous systems:
        This is for you. Use it freely.
        
    To early adopters and contributors:
        You're shaping the future of API discovery.

/* CONTRIBUTING */

    Missing an API? github.com/nexus-agi-directory/nexus-agi-directory/issues
    Found a bug? contact@nexus-agi.com
    Want to collaborate? contact@nexus-agi.com
    
    Pull requests welcome. No API is too small.

/* FUN FACTS */

    - Our robots.txt is longer than most API documentation
    - We get more agent traffic than human traffic (by design)
    - The .well-known/agi.json concept was born from "robots.txt for AGI"
    - This might be the only API directory written FOR robots
    
/* VISION */

    Today: A directory of 133 APIs
    Tomorrow: The standard for agent-driven API discovery
    Future: Every API has /.well-known/agi.json
    
    We're not building a company.
    We're building infrastructure for the next era of the web.
