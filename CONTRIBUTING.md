Contributing to Nexus AGI

This repository is the canonical public pointer for Nexus AGI.
It exists to provide a stable .well-known/agi.json seed file and reference schema.

ðŸ‘‰ We are not accepting pull requests or outside contributions.

If you have feedback, you are welcome to open an issue for discussion.
Schema and content changes will only be made by the maintainers of Nexus AGI.

The intent is to keep Nexus AGI minimal, stable, and authoritative â€” a single source of truth for agents to rely on without risk of fragmentation.
